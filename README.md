# **Applefest**

## ***Summary***
We created a completely redesigned website for Ithaca's annual Apple Harvest Festival as a final project for INFO 1300. Starting from scratch, we researched, designed, and implemented our project in the span of around 3 weeks. The original website is [here](http://www.downtownithaca.com/ithaca-events/Apple%20Harvest%20Festival%20Presented%20by%20Tompkins%20Trust).
