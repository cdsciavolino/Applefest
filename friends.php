                        Compete against your friends and win prizes playing classic carnival games at Applefest! Maybe you think you’ve outgrown these games, well, think again. Ever tried apple bobbing or ring toss after a few rounds of drinks? Give it your best shot. Or, while you’re at it, see who is the strongest among your friends and swing the hammer in the high striker to win prizes or at least a good laugh!

                    <p>
                        These are just a few of the activities you may find if you make it to Applefest this fall. Don’t let us tell you, see for yourself!
